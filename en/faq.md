 - My antivirus blocks switcher.
 - Yes, of course, the switcher will be blocked. It happens because the
   switcher is editing the windows hosts file. Just turn off antivirus,
   nothing bad will happen :)

-----------------------

 - I am getting “Connection Failed” error when connecting to the server.
 - Download the ripple version switcher, press the button Inspect. See
   this, yes? Everything is green? If not, ask for help in discord
   server. You can also check if you have disabled Windows Firewall.
   This can be a problem too, sometimes.

-----------------------

 - I need the certificate, for the N reason.
 - Yeah, no problem. [*link*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/514386067521142784/546689753299288075/kurikku.crt)

-----------------------

 - Bancho Authorization Failed, what to do?
 - Firstly, check have you typed login and password correctly. Second,
   check the connection to the server. You might be not connected as
   well.

-----------------------

 - And if I want back to peppy? How to do that?
 - There’s nothing hard, just press a button Switch to osu(ripple style
   switcher)! or вернуться на оффициальный банчо(gatari style switcher)
   that’s first button.

-----------------------

 - I definitely returned to Bancho, but I can't go through the site of
   osu? What to do?
 - Check that you shut down the osu! site before disabling the switcher
   and clear the browser cache + after going to Bancho, you need to wait
   at least 5 minutes, while local DNS views what hosts file will
   change.

-----------------------

 - You are the open-source project?
 - Yeah, as the ripple with their AGPL 3.0 license, damn her. We are the
   open-source project. You can get the sources on our GitHub. Its
  [*here*](https://github.com/osukatori).

-----------------------

 - My problem isn’t here.
 - Well, welcome to official discord Discord channel. There, we will try to
   help you with what you can’t do.
